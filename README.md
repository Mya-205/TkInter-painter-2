# TkInter-painter-2

This code calculates the cost of paint of 4 walls based on the length and height of all of them.

It has an option for the user to input their name, their email and the ISBN number that they are looking at. It then asks for the length of the four walls, and the height of all four walls.

It has 3 options: one for luxurypaint, which costs £1.75 per square metre, one for standard quality, wihch costs £1.00 per square metre and then one for economy quality, which cosrs £0.45 per square metre. The last option is for the undercoat, which would cost an extra £0.50 per square metre.

It checks if the ISBN number is valid, and then calulcates the area of the walls, and then calulates the cost of the paint needed, including the undercoat if selected.
